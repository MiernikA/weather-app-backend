# Weather-Based Energy Estimation API

This project consists of a Node.js server that uses Express to serve an API. The API endpoint provides weather data and estimates the amount of energy that could be generated from a solar panel based on the sunshine duration in a specified geographical location (latitude and longitude).

## Features

- Fetch weather data using latitude and longitude.
- Estimate solar energy generation based on sunshine duration.
- Simple error handling for invalid geographic coordinates.
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.
